      prompt: What is the primary reason containers are beneficial for scientific reproducibility?
      shuffleOptions: true
      options:
        - answer: They control the computing environment across different machines
          isCorrect: true
          feedback: |-
              Correct! Containers package the computing environment, ensuring consistency across different machines which is essential for reproducibility.
        - answer: They make computers run faster
          isCorrect: false
          feedback: |-
              Speed improvements are not mentioned as the primary benefit for scientific reproducibility. The main benefit is environment consistency.
        - answer: They automatically update software
          isCorrect: false
          feedback: |-
              Automatic updates are not the primary benefit for reproducibility. In fact, version control (not automatic updates) is what helps with reproducibility.
        - answer: They prevent software from being installed
          isCorrect: false
          feedback: |-
              Containers don't prevent software installation - they actually package software in a controlled way to ensure consistency.
        - answer: They reduce storage space requirements
          isCorrect: false
          feedback: |-
              Storage efficiency is not mentioned as the primary benefit for scientific reproducibility. The focus is on environment consistency.

      prompt: In the context of containers, what is the relationship between an image and a container?
      shuffleOptions: true
      options:
        - answer: An image is like a recipe, and a container is like the prepared meal from that recipe
          isCorrect: true
          feedback: |-
              Correct! This analogy accurately describes the relationship - an image is the template or blueprint from which containers (running instances) are created.
        - answer: An image is a running instance of a container
          isCorrect: false
          feedback: |-
              This reverses the relationship. Containers are the running instances created from images, not the other way around.
        - answer: Images and containers are the same thing
          isCorrect: false
          feedback: |-
              Images and containers are distinct concepts with different purposes. Images are immutable templates, while containers are running instances.
        - answer: Containers create images automatically
          isCorrect: false
          feedback: |-
              The relationship works in the opposite direction - images are used to create containers, not vice versa.
        - answer: Images are only used for storage purposes
          isCorrect: false
          feedback: |-
              While images are stored, their purpose extends beyond mere storage - they serve as templates for creating containers.

      prompt: According to the text, why can scientific results vary between different computers?
      shuffleOptions: true
      options:
        - answer: Due to variations in software versions, packages installed, and operating systems
          isCorrect: true
          feedback: |-
              Correct! These environmental differences can affect how scientific code runs, potentially leading to different results.
        - answer: Only because of different operating systems
          isCorrect: false
          feedback: |-
              Operating systems are just one factor - software versions and packages are also important variables that can affect results.
        - answer: Only because of user preferences
          isCorrect: false
          feedback: |-
              User preferences alone don't explain the variation in scientific results. The underlying computing environment differences are the key factor.
        - answer: Due to variations in hardware speed
          isCorrect: false
          feedback: |-
              Hardware speed may affect performance but isn't mentioned as a primary cause of varying scientific results in the context of reproducibility.
        - answer: Because of network connectivity differences
          isCorrect: false
          feedback: |-
              Network connectivity is not mentioned as a factor affecting scientific reproducibility across different computers.

      prompt: What is described as a potential impractical solution for controlling computing environments?
      shuffleOptions: true
      options:
        - answer: Shipping one laptop between all collaborators
          isCorrect: true
          feedback: |-
              Correct! This is mentioned as a theoretical but impractical solution that would technically ensure an identical computing environment.
        - answer: Using cloud computing
          isCorrect: false
          feedback: |-
              Cloud computing is generally presented as a practical solution, not an impractical one, for consistent environments.
        - answer: Installing identical software on all computers
          isCorrect: false
          feedback: |-
              While this approach might help, it's not identified as the specifically impractical solution mentioned in the text.
        - answer: Using virtual machines
          isCorrect: false
          feedback: |-
              Virtual machines are typically presented as a viable solution, not an impractical one, for environment control.
        - answer: Creating backup copies of software
          isCorrect: false
          feedback: |-
              Backups don't address the computing environment consistency issue that's central to scientific reproducibility.
