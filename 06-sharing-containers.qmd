## Activity Instructions {.panelset}

To share our docker image with others (or ourselves), we can push it to an online repository.

While there are lots of container registry options, for the purposes of this tutorial, we'll use Dockerhub.

First you'll need to make sure you have a dockerhub account.

Go to the website and login: https://hub.docker.com/

Next, locally you'll need to log into your account.

```
docker login -u your_user_name
```

It will ask for your password.

If you've logged in successfully, now we need to prep our image by putting our username in the name.

That may mean we need to rename it like this:
```
docker tag cool-new-image:2 username/cool-new-image:2
```

Now we can push it to our repository.
```
docker push username/cool-new-image:2
```

Go to https://hub.docker.com/repositories/ and you should see your image listed there!
